				<h1>Hobbies</h1>
				<p>All work and no play makes your life dull. So you need fun activities too. Hobbies are activities that are fun, entertaining and relaxing. Your hobby can be educative too. There are many kinds of hobbies. People pursue their hobbies with great passion and zest. Developing a hobby for your self will prove to be useful. Hobbies will help you use your leisure time gainfully. Your hobbies may be lifelong. You can pursue more than one hobby too.Music, dance, reading, story writing, sports, philately, painting and theatre may all be hobbies. Interestingly, one person’s profession may be another person’s hobby. For instance, one could be a professional flautist, but for another playing the flute could be a hobby. A hobby is a fun activity that is pursued during one’s leisure hours.</p>
